    passionate about various web technologies. I like to experiment with different web

    is what Rolwin loves to do. Check my blog which I update every week for some Javascript and some
    cool notes on web technologies.`,

    tools I use for <b>CI/ CD</b>. I'm always a learner and a self taught programmer.`,
